# App

## Overview

This is a project of an app based on [Magia Reacta](https://eduweb.pl/programowanie-i-www/reactjs/react-techniki-zaawansowane/) (React's Magic) course by Adam Roma≈Ñski.

Main focus of the course was practicing React. I was learning about React design patterns (HOCs, Render props), hooks and others. I was also practicing usage of Compound Components.
