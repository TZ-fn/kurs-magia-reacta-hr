# App

## Overview

This is a project of an app based on [Magia Reacta](https://eduweb.pl/programowanie-i-www/reactjs/react-techniki-zaawansowane/) (React's Magic) course by Adam Roma≈Ñski, in this app, I was learning advanced React practices, as well as testing React apps.

The main focus of the course was practising React. I was learning about design patterns such as: hooks, HOCs and Render props. I was also practising the usage of Compound Components.

Another course's topic was testing React apps where I was practising usage of Jest and React Testing Library.
